		<span class="p-head">BACKGROUND:</span>
		<p class="text-block">
			During a large part of the reign of the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East, the Ottoman military included an elite corps of soldiers known as Janissaries. Janissaries were Christian youths from Balkan provinces that were converted to Islam and were drafted either into the military or as part of the administrative elites. Well-trained, Janissaries were feared by other powers as they were highly skilled at their craft. Janissaries were sent to the Ottomans via a tax, the devsirme, that selected Christian youth from areas including Albania and Bosnia. Constantinople, founded in 330 CE, was the capital of the Byzantine Empire and had stood for over a thousand years as a thriving metropolis. Following the Crusades, Constantinople entered a state of disarray and instability, and it was only a matter of time before they were taken by the growing Ottoman Empire's influence to the east, signalling the end of the byzantine empire. In 1453, the Ottomans, including a large contingency of Janissaries, stormed Constantinople and decisively took the city, a high point for Mehmet II and the Ottomans.

			The air feels slightly humid this particular morning after yesterday's rains, and it sounds like your Balkan village is causing quite a stir this morning
			But wait, this doesn't sound quite like your village....
