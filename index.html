			During a large part of the reign of the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East, the Ottoman military included an elite corps of soldiers known as Janissaries. Janissaries were Christian youths from Balkan provinces that were converted to Islam and were drafted either into the military or as part of the administrative elites. Well-trained, Janissaries were feared by other powers as they were highly skilled at their craft. Janissaries were sent to the Ottomans via a tax, the <i>devsirme</i>, that selected Christian youth from areas including Albania and Bosnia. Constantinople, founded in 330 CE, was the capital of the Byzantine Empire and had stood for over a thousand years as a thriving metropolis. A major and well-defended city, leaders looked to take Constantinople to demonstrate their prowess. Following the Crusades, Constantinople entered a state of disarray and instability, and it was only a matter of time before they were taken by the growing Ottoman Empire's influence to the east, signalling the end of the Byzantine Empire. In 1453 CE, the Ottomans, led by Mehmed II and including a large contingency of Janissaries, stormed Constantinople and decisively took the city, a high point for Mehmed II and his empire.

			You [you can choose your name later!] are a farm boy living a fairly peaceful life in the rural Balkan highlands. You live in a family of two: you and your widowed mother live alone on a farm. A Christian, your family often holds prayer sessions throughout the day. After quite the downpour, you call it a day and tuck into bed, nearing your 15th birthday in 1451.
