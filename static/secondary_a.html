<h1>Third Decision (Secondary)</h1>

<p class="text-block"> You now feel much more adept in the arts of fighting and war. You know the vital points of the human body and you know every chink in the enemy's armor. You know how to move swift on your feet and attack with force. You have trained to become one of the fiercest warriors in the Ottoman army. 
</p>
<p class="text-block">
The leader of the Ottoman Army, Mehmed II, calls upon you and the rest of the Ottoman army to gear up for a siege of the city of Constantinople to the west.
You get put under the command of Zagan Pasha, the military commander of the land forces for the impending siege of Constantinople.
</p>
<p class="text-block">
You are selected as part of the battalion that will manning the bombards: heavy Ottoman artillery needing the attention of 200 other men and dozens of oxen.
The days are long as you march across Anatolia. The nights are restless as you nervously wait for the day to reach Constantinople.    
</p>
<p class="text-block">
Your worries grow steadily as the days grow nearer. Your past life starts to weigh down on your shoulders and you tend to feel more and more hesitant about this. You have never actually killed anybody, let alone hundreds of thousands of people. </p>

<p class="text-block">
A few days pass and one night, you wake up from a horrid nightmare drenched in cold sweat. Every other soldier in your unit is fast asleep, so you take the time to consider your options.
</p>

<p class="text-block">
Do you a) try to flee the unit and try to find your way back home to your village, or b) fight until the death with your unit.
