You shake off the thought of leaving your unit because you have nowhere else to go. You do not remember how to get back to the capital nor to your hometown. Besides, you have trained with these soldiers for over a year and a half and they are practically your family. You decide to fall back to sleep to prepare for the next day.</p>
<p class="text-block">
You and your unit wake up bright and early the next day and continue to march. Around midday you start to see visions of Constantinople off in the distance. Your unit gets all rallied up, and the morale of the unit seems to be filling the air with shouts.</p>
<p class="text-block">
The unit decides to set up camp for the day and rest for the long and bloody battle tomorrow. The next day, Mehmed II comes up to you with other soldiers and commands you to go and take out the remaining stronghold around the outskirts of the Byzantine Empire to allow for the other soldiers to pass through with relative ease.  After successfully besieging the stronghold, you regroup with the rest of the Ottoman army outside Constantinople's walls and help set up the artillery to bombard them. Another group of soldiers go siege the city by sea. You and 200 other men are able to blow a gaping hole through the wall where the soldiers outside the city are able to attack.</p>

The soldiers quickly make fine work out of the city. They siege the city and capture Constantinople for the Ottoman Empire.</p>
