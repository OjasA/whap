Your captors chuckle with a nodding motion. "A feisty one this is, this could prove to be useful for our purposes." They chuckle again. 
</p>

<span class="friendly-dialogue">"What are you guys laughing at? </span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"You little boy, can you wield a weapon?"</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">"Yeah, why? Are you planning to make me fight for your nefarious deeds? Well there’s no way that I’m going to fight for you, you barbaric filth." </span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"Well you have no choice you little scrawny farmboy. We could just chop off you head right now and send it back to you family, would you like that instead?"</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">"Maybe…" </span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"Alright then, Adem, grab me the axe. </span> <br/>
<p class="text-block">Your captor grabs your head and holds it on the table and raises the axe right above your neck.</p>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">"STOP STOP, I’LL FIGHT FOR YOUR EMPIRE."</span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"Good. Glad we agree. I’m sure we’ll be like brothers soon enough." </span> <br/>
<p class="text-block">They bound your burning wrists together again with the rope and drag you off to another place.
After a long uncomfortable ride, you noticed that the soldiers took you to some form of a school building.
You go in and see children of various ages and races that seem to be in the same situation as you. You are told to wait in line until someone acknowledges you. </p>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"Name?"</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue" id="name"></span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"Skills?"</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">"Why do I need to tell you? You don’t need to know."</span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"Look here, I don’t need you to be talking back at me, just tell me what you can do with your pathetic life so it can be easier for both of us."</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">"If you must know, if I had a sword in my hand, you’d be dead." </span> <br/>
<p class="text-block">The man chuckles a little.</p>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"Alright then, you’re going to be assigned to the military training class then so save your anger and hatred for me until later, you got that farmboy?" </span> <br/>
<p class="text-block">You mumble some swear words under your breath and then head off to your assigned classroom. </p>

<p class="text-block">One entire year of long and grueling military training passes. </p>
