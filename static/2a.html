Your captors chuckle with a nodding motion. "A feisty one this is, this could prove to be useful for our purposes." They chuckle again.

<div class="dialogue-wrapper">
<span class="friendly-dialogue">"What are you guys laughing at? </span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"You little boy, can you wield a weapon?"</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">"Yeah, why? Are you planning to make me fight for your nefarious deeds? Well there’s no way that I’m going to fight for you, you barbaric filth." </span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"Well you have no choice you little scrawny farmboy, we could just chop off you head right now and send it back to you family, would you like that instead?"</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">"Maybe…" </span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"Alright then, Adem, grab me the axe. </span> <br/>
<p class="text-block">Your captor grabs your head and holds it on the table and raises the axe right above your neck.</p>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">"STOP STOP, I’LL FIGHT FOR YOUR EMPIRE."</span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"Good. Glad we agree. I’m sure we’ll be like brothers soon enough." </span> <br/>
<p class="text-block">They bound your burning wrists together again with the rope and drag you off to another place.
After a long uncomfortable ride, you noticed that the soldiers took you to some form of a school building.
You go in and see children of various ages and races that seem to be in the same situation as you. You are told to wait in line until someone acknowledges you. </p>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"Name?"</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue" id="name"></span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"Skills?"</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">"Why do I need to tell you? You don’t need to know."</span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"Look here, I don’t need you to be talking back at me, just tell me what you can do with your pathetic life so it can be easier for both of us."</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">"If you must know, if I had a sword in my hand, you’d be dead." </span> <br/>
<p class="text-block">The man chuckles a little.</p>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"Alright then, you’re going to be assigned to the military training class then so save your anger and hatred for me until later, you got that farmboy?" </span> <br/>
<p class="text-block">You mumble some swear words under your breath and then head off to your assigned classroom. </p>

<p class="text-block">One entire year of long and grueling military training passes. </p>

<p class="text-block"> You now feel much more adept in the arts of fighting and war. You know the vital points of the human body and you know where every chink of the enemy’s armor are. You know how to move swift on your feet and attack with force. You have trained to become one of the fiercest warriors in the Ottoman army. 
The leader of the Ottoman Army, Mehmed II, calls upon you and the rest of the Ottoman army to gear up for a siege of the city of Constantinople to the west.
You get put under the command of Zagan Pasha, the military commander of the land forces for the impending siege of Constantinople.
You are selected as part of the battalion that will manning the bombards: heavy Ottoman artillery needing the attention of 200 other men and dozens of oxen.
The days are long as you march across Anatolia. The nights are restless as you nervously wait for the day to reach Constantinople.    
Your worries grow steadily as the days grow nearer. Your past life starts to weigh down on your shoulders and you tend to feel more and more hesitant about this. You have never actually killed anybody, let alone hundreds of thousands of people. </p>
