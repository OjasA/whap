The Ottoman soldier notices the stirring from the back of the caravan and sees your attempted escape. They shout some words to each other and start to chase you around the area. They manage to catch up to you and grab you from behind. To prevent you from trying to escape again, they tie the ropes even tighter. You feel much more uncomfortable than before, but you can still manage to slightly see outside the carriage.

You see an unfamiliar sight, but you have a vague recollection of this building in numerous paintings. You think that you are on the outskirts of Edirne, the capital of the Ottoman Empire. There are massive buildings and structures that you have never seen the likes of back in your homelands. The caravan travels through the streets of the city which allows you to explore the finer details. You notice that there seem to be various dome-like roofs on top of many large buildings; however, the caravan passes all these magnificent structures. You are released from the horse-drawn carriage and are dragged toward to some building that seems to be of high importance. Inside, you realize it must be academic establishment with all the scrolls of text laying beside the walls. You were gazing upon these scrolls when they force you into a rough seat and ask for your name, age and your skills.
