The Ottoman soldier notices the stirring from the back of the caravan and sees your attempted escape. They come back to grab you up and tie you even tighter. You feel much more uncomfortable than before, but you manage to slightly see outside the carriage.
You see an unfamiliar sight, but you have a vague recollection of this building in numerous paintings. You think that you are on the outskirts of Edirne, the capital of the Ottoman Empire. 
You are released from the horse-drawn carriage and are dragged toward to some building that seems to be of high importance. They force you into a seat.
They ask for your name, age and your skills.
