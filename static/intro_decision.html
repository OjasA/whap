It is the summer of 1451. The air feels slightly humid this particular morning after yesterday's rains, and it sounds like your Balkan village is causing quite a stir this morning. But wait, this doesn't sound quite like your village...

You wake up in the horse-drawn caravan and realize you are bound with ropes. Opening your eyes, you see Turkish men manning the horse as you travel through rough terrain. Beside you are a few other boys who look to be your age. None of them seem to be awake at this moment, even with all the galloping and noise. One of them looks like a friend of yours, but thereâ€™s no way of telling without causing a huge commotion and drawing attention to yourself.  The constant galloping of the horses along the ground fills the air, mixed in with the occasional voices of your Ottoman captors.

Luckily, the ropes are a little loose, so you have a little freedom of movement and you might be able to liberate yourself. Do you: a) Try to resist your capture and escape the horse-drawn caravan, or b) Stay in place like the good little boy that you are.
