You look around and double check to make sure everyone is asleep, and then you make your move. Leaving your equipment behind to minimize the noise, you tip toe your way out of your unit’s camp and check your bearings. You figure that the best way to escape is to return to Constantinople, and perhaps they’d send you back to your old home in the Balkans. You remember from your military training that Constantinople lies in the west, in the direction of the setting sun and moon. Your compass verifies this notion, and you set off towards the descending moon.</p>
<p class="text-block">
The hours pass by and the sun rises behind you. That’s good, you consider yourself lucky for having made it out of the camp without much of a scratch. The heated air bears down upon you, and you seek a nearby creek to catch a drink of water. You don’t want to be spending too much time walking out in the sun, so you take a nap and await the evening to embark on your return trip. </p>

Ah, the sun’s coming down again. You rise up from the ground and continue on westward. You figure that given the amount of time, Constantinople and its suburbs must be near. A campfire lies in the distance: you recognize its layout and realize that they are Byzantine forces and you begin to head toward them to ask for assistance.</p>
<p class="text-block">
As you approach the camp, you begin to hear shouting and yelling. Perhaps they are in a drunken stupor? Just as you begin to make out their faces, you are struck in the chest by a stone, followed by a sharp, piercing javelin from the front to back. You gasp for air, but your lungs have failed you, and you slowly slump onto the ground below. </p>

You have died after trying to escape fate. The Ottoman army never knows what happened to you. They took some effort trying to find you, but just assumed you were dead. You are forever forgotten by the army and have lost your place in the world.
