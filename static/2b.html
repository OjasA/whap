<span class="enemy-dialogue">"That’s unique coming from a farm boy like you. Most of your kind are only looking for war."</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">"I don’t see a whole lot of war. I just see some paintings and books from the passing caravans in the mountains." </span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"Heh, you’re as stupid as you look. Those paintings are nothing compared to the sublime Islamic art."</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">"Say what you like, but I do not care for your nonsense." </span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"Get back in the carriage, we’re going to enlighten you in the glorious teachings of Islam." </span> <br/>
<p class="text-block">They bound your burning wrists together again with the rope and drag you off to another place. 
After a long uncomfortable ride, you noticed that the soldiers took you to some form of a school building.

<span class="enemy-dialogue">"Skills?"</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">"I do not really have one skill per se, however, I am quite adept at studying the fine arts. I love immersing myself into paintings and observing their deeper, truer meaning." </span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"Good for you, but do you have any actual, useful skills…?" </span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">"Art is a useful skill, but if you must need a practical skill, I have studied much in the art of war and the masterpieces that successful strategies employ." </span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"OK, we’re going to make you a tactician, because even though you sometimes spend your time doing mostly useless things, you should be able to pick it up kind of quickly."</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">"I am already a masterful tactician, I don’t need your studies." </span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"Whatever, you obnoxious farmboy, just go to the class I assign you and follow the instructions, and then we shall have no problems in believing that you truly are a ‘masterful tactician’."</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">"Can I go home after that?" </span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">"No."</span> <br/>
<p class="text-block"> Two entire years of rigorous classes and training pass by. </p>
