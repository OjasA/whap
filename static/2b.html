<span class="enemy-dialogue">“That’s unique coming from a farm boy like you. Most of your kind are only looking for war.”</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">“I don’t see a whole lot of war. I just see some paintings and books from the passing caravans in the mountains.” </span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">“Heh, you’re as stupid as you look. Those paintings are nothing compared to the sublime Islamic art.”</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">“Say what you like, but I do not care for your nonsense.” </span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">“Get back in the carriage, we’re going to enlighten you in the glorious teachings of Islam.” </span> <br/>
<p class="text-block">They bound your burning wrists together again with the rope and drag you off to another place. 
After a long uncomfortable ride, you noticed that the soldiers took you to some form of a school building 
You go in and see children of various ages and races that seem to be in the same situation as you. You are told to wait in line until someone acknowledges you. </p>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">“Name?”</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue" id="name"></span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">“Skills?”</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">“I do not really have one skill per se, however, I am quite adept at studying the fine arts. I love immersing myself into paintings and observing their deeper, truer meaning.” </span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">“Good for you, but do you have any actual, useful skills…?” </span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">“Art is a useful skill, but if you must need a practical skill, I have studied much in the art of war and the masterpieces that successful strategies employ.” </span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">“OK, we’re going to make you a tactician, because even though you sometimes spend your time doing mostly useless things, you should be able to pick it up kind of quickly.”</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">“I am already a masterful tactician, I don’t need your studies.” </span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">“Whatever, you obnoxious farmboy, just go to the class I assign you and follow the instructions, and then we shall have no problems in believing that you truly are a ‘masterful tactician’.”</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">“Can I go home after that?” </span> <br/>
<span class="enemy-dialogue">“No.”</span> <br/>
<p class="text-block"> Two entire years of rigorous classes and training pass by. </p>

<p class="text-block"> You feel much more knowledgeable in the process behind the war. You know when and where to move the soldiers and how much food and firing power each squad provides. You also learn how to make use of the terrain and the advantages of high ground. You become much more adept in naval battle as well. 
One day, your knowledge and skill gets noticed by Mehmed II, the leader of the Ottoman empire and he assigns you be a commander of one regiment of his army. You are very honored at this accomplishment and you take the job with pride.
Within the next month, Mehmed calls upon you and other commanders to discuss his plans to take down the city to the west, Constantinople. He tells you to gear up and ready your regiment for battle. 
You and your troops march through the long, rough terrain of Anatolia to reach the great city. 
You finally see Constantinople off in the distance and you tell your soldiers to rest for the day.
The next day, at the break of dawn, you tell your soldiers to prepare for battle and charge at the city!
In the middle of the battle you are faced with the choice to either attack by land or by water. Since you know that there is a river surrounding Constantinople, you send yourself and some of your troops to attack by sea with the aid of Suleiman Baltoghlu to attack the city with the Ottoman fleet. However once you get near the city, you realize there is one problem... </p>
