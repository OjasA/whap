Good. Youâ€™re still screwed, but at least the soldiers were nice enough to not tie the ropes around your wrists too tightly and you are able to get a glimpse outside.
You see an unfamiliar sight, but you have a vague recollection of this building in numerous paintings. You think that you are on the outskirts of Edirne, the capital of the Ottoman Empire. 
You are released from the horse-drawn carriage and are dragged toward to some building that seems to be of high importance. They force you into a seat.
They ask for your name, age and your skills.
