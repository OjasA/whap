You order your sailors to head for the chain on the Golden Horn to expose the blockaded Byzantine fleet. Your fleet of ships slowly make their way across the Bosphorus towards the defensive chain. Knowing that your naval forces could suffer heavy casualties, you surround your utility craft with offensive vessels to distract the Byzantine defensive forces in the channel while your specialists cut the chains.</p>
<p class="text-block">
As your fleet advances, the naval battle intensifies. Your largest galleys position themselves to block the enemy from seeing your chain-cutter sailors at work. The small rowing boats reach the boom, and their sailors begin to slowly cut the chain.</p>
<p class="text-block">
BOOM! An intense push by the Byzantine defense sinks many of the Ottoman galleys, exposing the defenseless chain cutters in their small rowboats. Seeing the massive loss of ships, you call the operation off, but not before suffering heavy casualties of galleys, rowboats, and more importantly, your men.</p>

The Byzantine Emperor offers a peace treaty to call off the war. Seeing as how the casualties of the Ottoman army far surpass what was expect and increasing with every passing day, Mehmed decides to accept the peace treaty. This brings an end to the Ottoman siege of Constantinople and the prosperous city continues to stand. </p>
