You think that cutting the chains would take up too much time and stall out the siege, which would allow for the Constantinople troops to regroup. You tell your soldiers to steer the boat to shallow waters and then get out. Your soldiers question your decision at first, but since you are second in command, they do as you say. </p>

<span class="enemy-dialogue">"Commander, what in the devil’s name are you planning?"</span> <br/>
<span class="friendly-dialogue">"Just do as I say. Trust me, everything will turn out well. Now everybody get out of the boat!" </span>

You and your soldiers manage to carry the ships onto land and circumnavigate the chains. Every time your fleet came across a chain, they repeated the same process. </p>
<p class="text-block">
Eventually you are able to cut off any supplies and reinforcements for Constantinople. Your fleet prevents any ships from reaching the main city. You can see the effects of your fleet take their toll on Constantinople and they’re seem to be getting weaker with every passing day. A month later, the soldiers on land are able to break through the northwestern section of the wall and the soldiers came flooding into the city. </p>
<p class="text-block">
The soldiers quickly make fine work out of the city. They lay siege to the city and capture Constantinople for the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p class="text-block">
Constantinople has fallen. You are credited with many awards for your bravery and revered for your contribution to the war effort as a Commander. You live out the rest of your life basked in the glory, fame and riches of war.</p>
